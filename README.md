# 🖼️ Neural Style Transfer

Apply the **artistic style of one image** (e.g., a famous painting) to the **content of another image** using **Neural Style Transfer**. This project uses deep convolutional neural networks to blend style and content into a single, stylized output image.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Understand the core concepts behind Neural Style Transfer.
- Use pre-trained CNNs (like VGG19) to extract content and style features.
- Optimize a target image to combine the content of one image with the style of another.
- Experiment with different weights and styles to create artistic outputs.
